## What is Express Website Study?
Express Website Study is a study in the construction of a website with the express framework, whih cuts down the development time and complexity of you application.  In this study, we have a basic website with 2 informational pages and a contact page with working contact form.  The project also utilizes a number of middlewares including built-in middleware, third-party midddleware, etc.  I also wanted to cover two ways to build your express website by either using static files (i.e. html, etc.) and templating engines like pug.

## Does Express Website Study feature commentary?
Yes! I use extensive Commentary (mostly in the form of my thought process) so that the new and curious can follow the logic in the program and get an idea of my reasoning behind each and every line of code.  In addition to my line-by-line commantary, I also provide a Process text file that gives a good outline of my design and implementation process.
