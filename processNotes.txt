Process Notes
=============


PHASE 1: Setting up the project
===============================
STEP 1: Create a project folder.
STEP 2: Install express using "npm install -g express"
STEP 3: Create a .js file for your entry point (i.e. index.js, app.js, etc)
STEP 4: Initialize npm using "npm init"


PHASE 2: Install dependencies
==============================
STEP 5.1: Add dependencies by adding another property to your package.json file at the bottom:

        "dependencies": {
           "body-parser": "*",                           <== helps parse different types of data.  Note that the value is the version, but if you dont know the version use "*"
           "express": "*",                               <== latest version of express
           "pug": "*",                                   <== this is a templating engine (formerly jade)
           "nodemailer": "*",                            <==
        }
       
STEP 5.2: In gitbash, write "npm install" to install all the dependencies above.
        o   Note on this installation method:  It seems a little more intuitive to install dependencies like it is done above because you dont have to do "npm install x" 
            for each and every dependency you want to initially add (although it might be best to use npm install x later on into the project purely because its less work
            at that later point).  Plus, you can easily put in the dependency version like you have above.

STEP 5.3: Look in your new node_modules folders to see if all your dependcies have been added.


PHASE 3: Create a .gitignore file and add "node_modules" to it
===============================================================
STEP 6.1: Create a .gitignore file so that you dont add the addtional weight to the git repo
