Process Notes
=============


PHASE 1: Setting up the project
===============================
    STEP 1: Create a project folder.
    STEP 2: Install express using "npm install -g express"
    STEP 3: Create a .js file for your entry point (i.e. index.js, app.js, etc)
    STEP 4: Initialize npm using "npm init"


PHASE 2: Install dependencies
==============================
    o   To install dependencies there are two ways: 
            1. specify the dependencies in your package.json files and then when you are done, run "npm install" in gitbash
            2. Install each and every dependency 
    
    
    STEP 5.1A: Add dependencies by adding another property to your package.json file at the bottom:

            "dependencies": {
            "body-parser": "*",                           <== helps parse different types of data.  Note that the value is the version, but if you dont know the version use "*"
            "express": "*",                               <== latest version of express
            "pug": "*",                                   <== this is a templating engine (formerly jade)
            "nodemailer": "*",                            <== use this for form submissions
            }
        
    STEP 5.2A: In gitbash, write "npm install" to install all the dependencies above.
            o   Installation note:  It seems a little more intuitive to install dependencies like it is done above because you dont have to do "npm install x" 
                for each and every dependency you want to initially add (although it might be best to use npm install x later on into the project purely because 
                its less work at that later point).  Plus, you can easily put in the dependency version like in the method above.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        (or)

        STEP 5B: Do an "npm install x" in gitbash where "x" is the package you want to install for each and every one of your dependencies:

                npm install body-parser
                npm install express
                npm install pug
                npm install nodemailer

                (or) 

                npm install body-parser express pug nodemailer
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    STEP 5.3: Look in your new node_modules folders to see if all your dependcies have been added.


PHASE 3: Create a .gitignore file and add "node_modules" to it
===============================================================
    STEP 6.1: Create a .gitignore file so that you dont add the addtional weight to the git repo


PHASE 4: In your app.js file, create a basic express server.
=============================================================

                'use strict';
                                                                                        /* First, load modules you want to use in your application:*/
                const express = require('express');                                         /* load the express module and store as express */          
                const path = require('path');                                               /* load the path module (note: since this is a root module, you dont need to list in dependencies) */
                const bodyParser = require('body-parser');                                  /* load body-parser module is middleware that parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before handlers (available under req.body property)*/
                const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');                                   /* load nodemailer to allow easy email sending */
                                                                                        /* Second, initialize the express app */
                const app = express();                                                      /* initialize app by calling express and storing as "app" */
                                                                                        /* Third, set up your middleware */
                app.use(bodyParser.json())                                                  /* bodyparser middleware that can parse json*/
                app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));                          /* bodyparser middleware that can parse url */

                app.listen(3000, function() {                                           /* listen on port 3000 */
                    console.log('listening on port 3000...');                               /* log that the server is listenting on port 3000. */
                });

    o   When you go to localhost:3000, you will see "Cannot GET /", which is because we have not
        created a route yet for any of our future pages.

    o   To test out a basic route, add a simple GET route that calls a function with a request and response object:

                app.get('/', function(req, res) {
                    res.send('Hello there friend!')
                });
